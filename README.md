Project: STEAM is a game made for the Museum of Science and Industry 
to be used as a tool for camps to teach the fundamental concepts of programming
such as Mathematics, Loops, Conditionals, and the basics of functions

This program was developed for Windows only.  To install the product, simply 
download the "Project STEAM Download" zip file from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gx9tw3ak70rq7nr/Project%20STEAM%20Download.zip?dl=0), 
extract it, and press the "Project STEAM" executable icon to launch it

DO NOT touch the "Project STEAM_data" folder, as that folder contains all the data
needed to work with the executable.
